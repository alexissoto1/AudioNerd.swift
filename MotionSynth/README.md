# motionSynth

## Summary

motionSynth demonstrates using the CoreMotion API and Csound's CoreMotion bindings to make music and draw simple visuals to respond to an iOS device's motion sensors.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to CoreMotion.
- Queues and handlers, working with closures.
- Pulling from a device's motion data and pushing this data to somewhere.
- Csound and CoreMotion, the CsoundMotion class.

## Assignment

Modify this project to add and/or change some functionality. The .csd files can also be substituted or modified. A good exercise is also to try to recreate this project's behavior from scratch â€“ it is available as a reference, but re-implementing these behaviors can be helpful practice.

__Starter exercises to the reader:__

- Add more or lower-level drawing functionality, for other sensors than just the accelerometer.
- Add more control to the CSD, from other sensors and parameters.
- Try to build a different instrument that responds to the user in a way that feels like intuitive gestural control.
